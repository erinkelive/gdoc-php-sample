Sample of Source Code in PHP to acesses Google Docs API

This is a type os quick reference sample php code to integrate
Google Docs API in PHP, product of more than 60 hours grindind
and testing codes, not 100% right, with many bugs yet. Because of
the lack of informations (even from google to developers) of how
we can use your GAPIs script's in developer languages like PHP.

This sample is a little important to developers because some times 
we need to host our codes in some REMOTE HOST. And, this remote host, 
sometimes don't give us terminal access to use commands like 
"compose require xxx", so i'd to grind for hours to remove unused files
from google library, grind more hours to edit some part of that librarys
to adapt the functions. Functions that never work good in remote servers.

Importat to say, files in vendor folder MAY BE EDITED or ADAPTED, if u use
this code, i think u can have problems if u update ur vendor composer.

Use this sample at ur own risk!! we don't warrant or grant anything.
It's free to ur use.

So, this is just a simple library to access GDocs API in PHP language
samples of insert text function, create file in GDoc, Authenticate,
and some others functions like set background/foreground colors, bolds,
etc...

Your can use pieces or full code for free, 
but we request some contribution (code updates or sugestions/critics) 
from you to this free utilization of this code sample.

Thx.
